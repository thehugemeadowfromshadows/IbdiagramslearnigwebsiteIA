                <h2>Osmosis and Diffusion</h2>
                <p>Osmosis is the passive movement of water molecules across a semipermeable membrane from a region of lower solute concentration to a region of higher solute concentration, aiming to equalize solute concentrations on both sides of the membrane. Diffusion, on the other hand, is the process by which molecules spread from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration until there is an equal distribution of molecules in the space available. Both processes are fundamental to the movement of substances in biological systems and do not require energy input from the cell (passive transport)</p>

<h2>Diffusion</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Diffusion:</strong> Diffusion is the spontaneous, passive movement of molecules or particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. It occurs until equilibrium is reached, where there is an equal concentration of the substance throughout the space.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Concentration Gradient:</strong> A concentration gradient is the difference in the concentration of a substance (usually a solute) between two regions or areas. Diffusion occurs along this gradient, as particles move from areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentration.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Passive Transport:</strong> Diffusion is a form of passive transport, meaning it does not require energy input from the cell or system. Instead, it relies on the inherent kinetic energy of molecules to move.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Molecular Motion:</strong> Diffusion is driven by the random motion and collisions of molecules or particles in a fluid (liquid or gas). These particles move in all directions but tend to net movement toward areas of lower concentration.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Rate of Diffusion:</strong> The rate of diffusion is a measure of how quickly a substance spreads or moves through a medium. It depends on factors such as temperature, the size of the particles, and the permeability of the medium.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Fick's Laws of Diffusion:</strong> Fick's laws are mathematical equations that describe the rate of diffusion and the factors that influence it. Fick's first law relates the rate of diffusion to the concentration gradient, surface area, and membrane thickness, while Fick's second law deals with changes in concentration over time.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Membrane Permeability:</strong> The ability of a membrane to allow certain substances to pass through while blocking others is referred to as membrane permeability. In biological contexts, cell membranes are selectively permeable, meaning they control the diffusion of specific molecules and ions.
</p>
            


                    <h2>Osmosis</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        <strong>Osmosis:</strong> Osmosis is the specific type of diffusion that involves the movement of solvent molecules, usually water, from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration through a semi-permeable membrane. It aims to equalize the concentration of solute on both sides of the membrane.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <strong>Semi-Permeable Membrane:</strong> A semi-permeable membrane is a barrier that allows certain molecules, typically small solvents like water, to pass through while blocking larger solute molecules. Cell membranes are classic examples of semi-permeable membranes.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <strong>Hypertonic Solution:</strong> A hypertonic solution is one with a higher concentration of solute compared to another solution. When a cell is placed in a hypertonic solution, water tends to move out of the cell, causing it to shrink or undergo crenation.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <strong>Hypotonic Solution:</strong> A hypotonic solution is one with a lower concentration of solute compared to another solution. When a cell is placed in a hypotonic solution, water tends to move into the cell, causing it to swell and potentially burst (lysis).
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <strong>Isotonic Solution:</strong> An isotonic solution is one with the same concentration of solute as another solution. When a cell is placed in an isotonic solution, there is no net movement of water, and the cell maintains its normal shape and size.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <strong>Osmotic Pressure:</strong> Osmotic pressure is the pressure exerted by the solvent (usually water) as it moves through a semi-permeable membrane to equalize the solute concentrations on both sides. It represents the force required to prevent the net movement of solvent due to osmosis.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <strong>Turgor Pressure:</strong> Turgor pressure is the pressure exerted by the fluid (often water) inside the central vacuole of plant cells against the cell wall. It helps maintain the cell's shape and rigidity. Osmosis plays a significant role in establishing turgor pressure.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <strong>Plasmolysis:</strong> Plasmolysis is the shrinking or shrinking away of the cell membrane from the cell wall due to water loss in a hypertonic solution. It is a common phenomenon in plant cells.
                    </p>
