                <h2>Glucose and Ribose</h2>
                <p>Bacteria are single-celled prokaryotic organisms. They are smaller than animal and plant cells (eukaryotic cells), and they contain all the structures needed for their survival. Bacterial cells have two types of non-membrane-bound structures that contain their DNA—a circular chromosome that contains their essential genes and several small, circular plasmids that contain nonessential genes such as antibiotic resistance genes. This model shows a gram-negative bacterial cell.</p>

                        <strong>Glucose</strong><br>
                
                            <strong>Chemical Identity:</strong> Glucose is a monosaccharide, the simplest form of carbohydrate. Its chemical formula is C₆H₁₂O₆.<br>
                            <strong>Structure:</strong> It consists of six carbon atoms, forming a hexagonal ring in its cyclic form. There are two cyclic forms of glucose, α-glucose and β-glucose, which differ in the position of the hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to the first carbon atom.<br>
                            <strong>Isomers:</strong> Glucose has several isomers, including fructose and galactose, which have the same molecular formula but differ in the arrangement of atoms.<br>
                            <strong>Role in Nature:</strong> Glucose is a primary source of energy for cells in many organisms. It's involved in cellular respiration and is a key substrate in various metabolic pathways.<br>
                            <strong>Sources:</strong> Commonly found in fruits, honey, and in the blood of animals as blood sugar.<br>
                            <strong>Commercial Use:</strong> Widely used in the food industry as a sweetener and a preservative.<br>
                        
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Ribose</strong><br>
                        <strong>Chemical Identity:</strong> Ribose is also a monosaccharide, with the chemical formula C₅H₁₀O₅.<br>
                        <strong>Structure:</strong> It is composed of five carbon atoms, forming a pentagonal ring in its cyclic form. Ribose is an aldopentose, meaning it contains five carbons and includes an aldehyde group.<br>
                        <strong>Role in Nature:</strong> Crucially important in biochemistry, ribose is a component of RNA (ribonucleic acid). It forms the backbone of RNA, connecting with phosphate groups and nitrogenous bases.<br>
                        <strong>Prsesnce in DNA:</strong> In deoxyribose, a derivative of ribose, the sugar found in DNA, one of the hydroxyl groups is replaced by a hydrogen, hence the "deoxy" in the name.<br>
                        <strong>Importance in ATP:</strong> Ribose is also a component of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is vital for energy transfer in cells.<br>
                        <strong>Sources and Uses:</strong> Not as commonly found in the diet as glucose, but it is available in RNA-rich foods and is used in some health supplements.

                <p>
                    <strong>Saturated Fatty Acids</strong><br>
                    
                    <strong>Chemical Identity:</strong> Saturated fatty acids are a type of fat molecule without double bonds between carbon atoms. Their general formula is CH₃(CH₂)nCOOH, where 'n' is a variable number of carbon atoms.<br>
                    <strong>Structure:</strong> They consist of a long hydrocarbon chain with a single covalent bond between carbon atoms and a carboxylic acid group at one end.<br>
                    <strong>Characteristics:</strong> Due to the lack of double bonds, they are typically solid at room temperature and are found in animal fats and some plant oils.<br>
                    <strong>Role in Nutrition:</strong> Saturated fatty acids are important for energy storage, cellular membrane structure, and as precursors for various biological compounds.<br>
                    <strong>Sources:</strong> Common sources include butter, cheese, red meat, and certain plant oils like coconut oil.<br>
                    <strong>Health Implications:</strong> Excessive consumption can contribute to cardiovascular diseases, but they are essential in moderation for balanced nutrition.<br>

                <p>
                    <strong>Generalized Amino Acid</strong><br>
                    <strong>Chemical Identity:</strong> Amino acids are organic compounds that serve as the building blocks of proteins. Their general formula is NH₂CH(R)COOH, where 'R' is a variable side chain.<br>
                    <strong>Structure:</strong> Each amino acid contains an amine group (NH₂), a carboxylic acid group (COOH), and a distinctive side chain (R group), attached to a central carbon atom.<br>
                    <strong>Types:</strong> There are 20 standard amino acids that make up proteins, each with a unique R group that determines its properties.<br>
                    <strong>Role in Nature:</strong> Amino acids are crucial for protein synthesis, playing key roles in various metabolic processes and cellular functions.<br>
                    <strong>Protein Structure:</strong> The sequence and nature of amino acids in a protein determine its structure and function.<br>
                    <strong>Importance in Diet:</strong> Essential amino acids must be obtained through diet, as they are not synthesized by the human body.<br>
                    <strong>Sources:</strong> Found in high-protein foods like meat, eggs, dairy products, and legumes, as well as in some plant-based sources.<br>
